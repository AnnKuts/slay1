Was doing [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3), so I made this short website in July 2024 to learn HTML and CSS a bit. Don't judge it. There is also a JavaScript file, which I added when started learning JavaScript. Just hope this one will help me to improve my skills and get better.
